      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      The Gobo Team is part of the Civic Media Group in the Media Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ("MIT"). Gobo is a website that analyzes and lets you filter the social media content you see from your feed. Gobo is committed to respecting the privacy of users who access the Gobo website (the “Site,” which includes all pages within gobo.social).<br />

      <h2>Web Server Logs</h2>

      When you visit the Site, our web server may record the following information in its server log:<br />
      <ul>
        <li>your IP Address,</li>
        <li>the URLs on the Site you have requested to access,</li>
        <li>the dates and methods of requests,</li>
        <li>the status code of your requests,</li>
        <li>URLs of pages that referred you to the Site,</li>
        <li>number of bytes transferred, and</li>
        <li>your web browser and operating system platform.</li>
      </ul>
      We use server log information to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website by identifying which parts of our site are most heavily used. We also use this information to tailor site content to user needs and to generate aggregate statistical reports. Web server logs are retained on a temporary basis, during which time their contents are accessible to Site administrators, and then deleted completely from our systems. Unless required by legal process, we do not link IP addresses to any personally identifiable information.<br />
      In addition, we ordinarily do not disclose to third parties site usage by individual IP addresses, but we may do so in very limited circumstances when complying with law or legal process, working with consultants assisting us with fixing or improving the Site, or monitoring and improving the security of our network.<br />

      <h2>User Registration and User Generated Content</h2>
      To obtain user registration, you must submit your email address to the Site, along with authorization to access your feed on Twitter and/or Facebook. We will use that authorization to load the most recent posts you see on either website.
      The Site allows you see and filter posts from your feed on both social media sites if you are a registered user. The posts you see will only be viewable by yourself.<br />
      We will not disclose your email address or the posts you see anywhere on the Site.<br />
      From time to time we may solicit feedback from you about your use of the Site and its features (your “Feedback”). You are not required to provide Feedback. We solicit Feedback for internal purposes only, so that we can evaluation the Site and its features, and we will not publish or otherwise disclose your Feedback without first obtaining your consent to do so.  We can ask you for time to do unstructured interviews to gather your thoughts about the Site.  Anonymous quotes from these interviews could be used in academic research papers.<br />

      <h2>Programming Analytics</h2>
      In order to refine the resources on offer through the Site and to optimize Gobo's programming, Gobo may elect to conduct internal analytics of how you use the site. Any such internal analytics will be conducted in an anonymized way.<br />

      <h2>Analytics</h2>
      We use Google Analytics to perform Site usage analytics. Google Analytics collects information from users to help us track Site usage and referrals from other websites. These data are used primarily to optimize the website experience for our visitors, and also to understand how the Site is being used.<br />
      Information collected and processed by Google Analytics includes the user’s IP address, network location, and geographic location. Google Analytics acquires all its information directly from the user, by installing a cookie (see below) on JavaScript-enabled computers. The Site does not share any information it collects with Google Analytics, and Google Analytics does not collect any personal identifying information such as names, contact information, social security numbers or financial information.<br />

      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      Cookies are unique bits of computer data that many major websites will transfer to your computer the first time that you visit. Cookies are stored on your hard drive and may be later accessed by the website to track prior usage. As noted above, Google Analytics will install a cookie on the hard drives of Site visitors.<br />

      <h2>E-mail</h2>
      We will only use your email address for the purpose for which you have provided it — i.e., to respond to a message from you or to communicate with you regarding your user account.<br />
      In the event we contract with a third-party service to assist with email delivery of newsletters and other mailings containing information about the Site, that service will be prohibited from using or sharing Site user information for any purpose other than facilitating communications on behalf of the Site.<br />

      <h2>Disclosure to Third Parties</h2>
      We will not sell, lend, or disclose to third parties any personally identifiable information collected from visitors, except as disclosed in this Policy or in the event we are required by law to do so. We may disclose information to employees, fellows, students, consultants and agents who have a legitimate need to know the information for the purpose of fixing or improving the Site and monitoring and improving the security of our network. We may also disclose this information when special circumstances call for it, such as when disclosure is required by law or court order or when disclosure is, in our sole discretion, necessary to protect our legal rights, including intellectual property rights.<br />

      <h2>Other Websites</h2>
      This Site may contain links to other web resources, including websites of organizations other than the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The websites to which the Site links may also install cookies on your computer, log your access to their web pages, or collect user-identifying information directly from you, once you proceed to browse those sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies of other sites or businesses to which the Site provides links. Please visit the relevant sites to review their privacy policies.<br />

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      We have in place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect the information we collect online. However, as effective as these measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot completely guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. The Site only keeps track of the most recent 1000 posts from your feeds, periodically deleting older posts.<br />

      <h2>Notification of Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
      We will review our security measures and Privacy Policy on a periodic basis, and we may modify our policies as appropriate. We may also change or update our Privacy Policy if we add new services or features. If any changes are made, we will make appropriate amendments to this policy, post them at the Site, and notify you. If changes are major, such that they affect your rights, safety or welfare, you will need re-consent. We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy on a regular basis.
      If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices of this Site, or your dealings with this Site, you can contact the Gobo team at gobo@media.mit.edu.

      <h2>Effective Date</h2>
      This Privacy Policy is in effect as of Sept 7, 2017.<br />
      <br />
